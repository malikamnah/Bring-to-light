        <h1>COUNSELLING</h1>
        <p>What is counselling?</p>
        <p>Counselling is a <em>process</em> in which we through a therapeutic relationship <em>explore</em> feelings, thoughts, behaviours, patterns and symptoms. This is your unique <em>journey</em> to take as I witness, support, make space for it to emerge. Counselling is not the same as giving advice, but instead though talk therapy and various strategies it allows for awareness, choices and solutions to organically emerge.</p>

        <p>What is Mindfulness-Based Somatic Therapy¬Æ (MBST)</p>
        <p>Emotions that are pushed away and not processed for a long period of time tend to get ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù in our body and can turn into various physical issues. This can include reoccurring pain, symptoms and even our posture. <br>
        In a gentle and slow way, MBST can locate these held ‚Äúfelt senses‚Äù and allow for releasing and freeing though bodies own capacity to heal. (see more on MBST).</p>

        <p>Who is counselling for?</p>
        <p>Counselling is really for <em>anyone</em> who is struggling with different aspects of their lives. Although counselling can help in crisis situations or when things have become very tough, it can also help us in the ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù day-to-day stresses and in such become a great way to prevent crisis.</p>

        <p>How can counselling help?</p>
        <p>Through counselling, you will become more self-aware in recognising your own life patterns. This awareness empowers you to create healthier choices for yourself and eventually create a long-term change as well as build resilience. Counselling can also help with processing difficult past, help grieve a loss learn skills such as communication, coping, mindfulness, self-care, boundaries setting. </p>

        <p>What is it like going to counselling?</p>
        <p>Although the experience varies for people, it is normal to feel nervous, unsure, worried as you begin. I encourage you to voice these to me if you feel them, so we can together work with them. It is not uncommon to feel emotional during the process as we speak about difficult but <em>important</em> things.<br>
        Having said that, counselling can bring about a sense of excitement and relief as you make progress and I have also head people say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know counselling could be fun!‚Äù üòä</p>
        <p>Know that this is all <em>normal</em> and I will be here to support you through it. </p>
        
        <p>Fees:</p>
        <p>I offer a free consultation where you can ask questions and see if this feels like a good fit for you.</p>
