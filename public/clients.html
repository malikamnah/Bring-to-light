        <p>Record keeping and viewing</p>
        <p>During and/or after sessions counsellors write progress notes and keep basic information on file. They are always kept locked up and are never shared unless required by law (see below-confidentiality). You have the right to review your files.</p>

        <p>Confidentiality</p>
        <p>Everything we speak about is strictly confidential, meaning I do not share any aspect of your information with anyone else unless it is required by law in rare cases such as where; a vulnerable member of the community is being or at risk of harm, such as a child or elderly; you or someone else is in danger of harm, if I receive a subpoena by a court. I also discuss cases with my supervisor; however, your identity will not be revealed.</p>

        <p>Supervisor</p>
        <p>As required, I am regularly supervised to maintain best ethical practice. I share case information with her to receive her guidance however I do not reveal your identity. Contact information for my supervisor is available upon request.</p>

        <p>Service disagreement</p>
        <p>If you feel unhappy with the service provided, your feedback is appreciated. First address the issue with me, for resolution. If this cannot be accomplished, you may address your concerns in writing to the Association of Cooperative Counselling Therapists and/or my Clinical Supervisor.</p>
