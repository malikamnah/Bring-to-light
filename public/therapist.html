        <h1>About Amnah</h1>
        <p>My approach is Person-Centred, meaning I; value our therapeutic relationship highly with respect and dignity, believe that you are capable of making your own choices that feel right to you, see you as a whole person from a holistic perspective (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, social), value your unique needs, abilities, beliefs, cultures.</p>

        <p>I incorporate various techniques from other modalities such as Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), Gestalt therapy and Art therapy.</p>

        <p>I have experience working with individuals struggling with: anxiety, depression, grief, parenting and relationship issues, trauma, self-esteem and more.<br>
        Although stress is a natural and sometimes healthy part of life, there are times when it may feel "too much to handle", we may feel stuck, lost and overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <p>With compassion and without judgement, I attentively listen to your concerns and can help expand your awareness of what may be some underlying causes. With exploration, together we can start to discover realistic solutions, coping skills, and tools best suited for you as an individual that also aligns with your personal goals.</p>
